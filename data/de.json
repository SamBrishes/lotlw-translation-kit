        "rogue_historian_diag_4": "Oh, yeah. Why else I would be here?",
        "rogue_historian_diag_5": "You shrug.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_6": "Continue conversation?",
        "rogue_historian_diag_7": "How do people become rogues?",
        "rogue_historian_diag_8": "Usually by committing very serious crimes. Again with that look. My crime was merely writing a book.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_9": "I was a historian and people didn't like what I wrote, to put it lightly. You see, I think monarchy was good for Kayos.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_10": "Councils and elections are great, sure, but, damn, when a king decides to get something done, it happens.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_11": "I expressed such views in my book, so I was called a monarchist and made a rogue.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_12": "There is a spell that creates this irremovable glowing mark. The guards attack rogues on sight, that's why I am here, living in the desert.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_13": "That is horrible.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_14": "It is. The city councils keep talking about building prisons, making punishments reversible and more humane, but nothing has been done for years.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_15": "He sighs.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_16": "That's what happens when the monarchy isn't in charge.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_17": "He says, almost mockingly. He seems regretful.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_18": "What happened? To the monarchy, I mean?",
        "rogue_historian_diag_19": "The rebellion happened. Talyann the Third wasn't a good king and war broke out.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_20": "It lasted seven bloody years and ended with monarchy losing.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_21": "At the end of the war, Talyann the Fourth blew up half of what was the Kingdom of Azu'urunn.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_22": "Half of the inhabited lands, basically. Three cities were in the range of the King's Spell, hundreds of thousands died.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_23": "Five years later, my book was released, and, well, you know what happened.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_24": "I'm starting to understand why you were made a rogue.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_25": "Oh yeah?",
        "rogue_historian_diag_26": "Historian says sarcastically and shakes his head.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_27": "I should have waited before writing that damn book.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_28": "Nowadays I could get away with just becoming a widely unliked person. It was a bit early to express that kind of opinion.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_29": "There is another thing that I regret. I wrote that this whole rogue thing was a good way to deal with criminals.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_30": "I don't think that anymore. I have to admit, not everything monarchy did was good. Rebels had a point.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_31": "See? I'm reasonable.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_32": "He makes a sour smile.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_33": "Oh, well. Go now, leave the old fool with his throughs.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_34": "Go.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_35": "Well, I'd talk with you, but I don't want to be here longer than I have to.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_36": "Disappointment appears on the old man's face, but he nods.",
        "rogue_historian_diag_37": "Fair enough. Bye, stranger.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_0": "Hello!",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_1": "Hello.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_2": "You look troubled, what's the problem?",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_3": "Oh, it's nothing, I'm just trying to get to Locul.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_4": "I can help you with that, I know a shortcut.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_5": "Hmm...",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_6": "C'mon, you can trust me.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_7": "Trust her?",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_8": "Thank you, but I don't think I need help.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_9": "Woman narrows her eyes.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_10": "Well, okay. Show me the way.",
        "diag_helpful_rogue_11": "Good job, Alanna.",
        "ria_quest_started_0": "You need to get to the town, it's not safe here.",

        "diag_kayos_intro_3": "A smell of smoke, iron, and hot stone. A taste of dust. A view of pits, rocks, and broken equipment.",
        "diag_kayos_intro_4": "Kayos.",
        "diag_kayos_intro_5": "You say quietly, just to hear how it sounds again. It's the first time you used this word. You know that it's not the last.",
        "diag_kayos_intro_6": "A strange feeling overtakes you, a mix of hope and anxiety. A bit of hope and lots of anxiety.",
        "diag_kayos_intro_7": "Your thoughts are interrupted when you hear shouting again. It's closer this time. You have to move.",
        "diag_45": "Hi, I'm looking for something to do.",
        "diag_46": "Aden looks at you.",
        "diag_47": "Are you an immigrant?",
        "diag_48": "That's what everyone is calling me.",
        "diag_49": "Got it. Can you fight? I got a bit of a rogue problem.",
        "diag_50": "A rogue problem?",
        "diag_51": "Here in Kayos, we don't put our criminals in the prisons, like in more civilized worlds.",
        "diag_53": "We mark them with magic and then try to keep them away from settlements.",
        "diag_54": "We call them rogues. Most of them continue being a threat to civilians.",
        "diag_56": "Yeah, I noticed.",
        "diag_57": "Well, it's not hard to keep them away from this town, rogues in the desert aren't well equipped. At least for now. That brings me to my problem.",
        "diag_58": "You see, before me, the guard captain was Drenn Beknom.",
        "diag_59": "He is a monarchist and Lord Atan's ally. He wanted to take over Locul and turn it into Lord Atan's outpost to attack Eastern Trilith.",
        "diag_60": "I'm sorry, but that does not mean anything to me.",
        "diag_61": "What you need to know is that we overthrew our king twenty years ago after a long war.",
        "diag_62": "There are still people who want tyranny back, most notable of them is Lord Atan. He's trying to crown himself and restore the monarchy.",
        "diag_63": "Drenn wants to help Atan. Drenn was probably from the minority of people who had a good life during the reign and lost that during the war.",
        "diag_64": "So what happened to him?",
        "diag_65": "Long story short, I found out about his plans, now he's a rogue hiding in the desert and I have become a captain.",
        "diag_66": "I'm worried that Drenn have not abandoned his plans. I have reports of rogues becoming more organized.",
        "diag_67": "A weapon merchant was attacked a few days ago. A crate of swords and arrow launcher parts was taken.",
        "diag_68": "I think Drenn is behind this.",
        "diag_69": "Here's the deal: You kill Drenn for me, bring me his captain's badge, and I reward you with a thousand gold.",
        "diag_70": "Sounds good?",
        "diag_110": "You suppress a hysteric laugh.",
        "diag_84": "So that's what kind of world it is? I'm not a pacifist, but I'm also not a bounty hunter. I don't think I can do it.",
        "diag_85": "Oh, you can. And you should. If you won't stop Drenn, innocent people might die.",
        "diag_86": "And yeah, that's what kind of world Kayos is. But you can help make it better. Preserve what's left of civilization after centuries of regime.",
        "diag_87": "%A monarch does not feed those who disobey.%",
        "diag_88": "Aden scoffs.",
        "diag_89": "That was the official policy of the monarchy for two hundred years. But kings and queens are no more. Things are going to change.",
        "diag_90": "The prisons will be built, the guilty will be properly judged and punished, Kayos will become a safer world.",
        "diag_91": "Armed guards and bounty hunters won't be needed anymore.",
        "diag_71": "We just have to survive until then.",
        "diag_72": "...",
        "diag_73": "Okay, I'll think about it.",
        "diag_74": "Yeah, do that. As I said, bring me his badge, and I'll reward you.",
        "diag_75": "See you later.",
        "diag_76": "Hey, did you do it?",
        "diag_77": "Yes, here's his badge.",
        "diag_78": "I told you got what it takes. Don't think about it too much, sometimes you got to spill the blood to protect the civilization.",
        "diag_100": "You are right, but I don't know if it should be me who does that. Maybe-... No. I can't think about this right now.",
        "diag_101": "Just know that Kayos needs fighters and defenders. Take your gold, you really earned it.",
        "diag_79": "Aden hands you reward.",
        "diag_80": "Well, that's it I guess. I got no more quests for you at the moment.",
        "diag_81": "Alright, bye for now. I'll go spend that gold.",
        "diag_111": "Yeah, you do that.",
        "diag_82": "Not yet.",
        "diag_83": "Well, hurry up then.",
        "diag_99": "Hey, about that job I gave you. Don't worry about it, someone else has killed him",
        "diag_102": "...",
        "diag_104": "Got no quests for you at the moment. Come back later.",
