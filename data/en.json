"noru_diag_7":	"You relay that information to Noru, he writes it down, then takes out a money pouch and hands it to you.",

"noru_diag_11":	"Hmm... LMC needs an ore grinder operator. Oh, never mind, I forgot to cross that out.",

"diag_quest_1_end_1":	"Your old life is over.",
"diag_quest_1_end_2":	"It was far from perfect, but you worked hard to create it and thinking about what you lost is almost insufferable.",
"diag_quest_1_end_3":	"Despite that, you find yourself ready to work again.",

"ria_diag_0":	"It stopped. You saw visions of worlds, they were changing faster than you could realize what you were looking at. But it stopped.",
"ria_diag_1":	"You look at the unfamiliar landscape.",
"ria_diag_2":	"You are definitely not in Ocia. The sky is blue and there are no rings.",
"ria_diag_3":	"You start feeling lightheaded.",
"ria_diag_4":	"Hi! I am Ria, are you alright?",
"ria_diag_5":	"Uh... I don't know, am I?",
"ria_diag_6":	"More or less. Welcome to Kayos, the Locked World!",
"ria_diag_7":	"But I was supposed to be in Ocia.",
"ria_diag_8":	"The World Gate you entered has malfunctioned and teleported you here, instead of a world it was linked to.",
"ria_diag_9":	"It's called link interference, you are not the first to get here this way.",
"ria_diag_10":	"So how do I get back to my world?",
"ria_diag_11":	"I am very sorry, but you can't do anything. As I said, Kayos is the Locked World, there's no way to leave it and the only way to enter it is via interference.",
"ria_diag_12":	"It takes you a few moments to process what Ria said. Suddenly you become overwhelmed with emotions: Shock, fear, confusion, disbelief.",
"ria_diag_13":	"I... I don't...",
"ria_diag_14":	"Ria waits until you calm down. With some effort, you bottle up the emotions. Now it's not time to panic.",
"ria_diag_15":	"If it makes you feel any better, you'll get compensation and will be able to start a new life here. There is a program for immigrants like you.",
"ria_diag_16":	"Speaking of...",
"ria_diag_17":	"Ria gives you a small paper card.",
"ria_diag_18":	"This is your proof of immigration. Don't lose it.",
"ria_diag_19":	"Wh-... What now?",
"ria_diag_20":	"Now you need to reach the town of Locul. The path to it is dangerous, so I'll give you a weapon and healing kits.",
"ria_diag_21":	"I don't understand, dangerous in what way?",
"ria_diag_22":	"It goes through a territory controlled by rogues. They are criminals of all kinds.",
"ria_diag_23":	"If you encounter anyone on your way to the town, don't speak with them, and if they attack you, well, that's why you need a weapon.",
"ria_diag_24":	"What weapon you are most familiar with? I've got a few swords, staves, and a bow with arrows.",
"ria_diag_25":	"Give me a sword.",
"ria_diag_26":	"Here you go.",
"ria_diag_27":	"Ria hands you a sword and three healing kits.",
"ria_diag_28":	"Thank you.",
"ria_diag_29":	"Ria smiles.",
"ria_diag_30":	"Just doing my job. When you get to the town, take the immigration proof to Noru. He is in a building with the WELCOME sign.",
"ria_diag_31":	"And... Kayos is not great at making good first impressions, but trust me, it's a fine world to live in. I hope you will find your place here. Now go.",
"ria_diag_32":	"Bye.",

"regretful_rogue_diag_3":	"I don't want to, so I won't unless you make me.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_4":	"Thank you. I know you are an immigrant, so I want you to know that despite what you've probably been told, not all rogues are murderous maniacs.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_5":	"That's a relief.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_6":	"You say, sarcastically.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_7":	"Rogue sighs.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_8":	"So, I'll be going now.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_9":	"Wait, take this.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_10":	"Rogue gives you iron helmet.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_11":	"It will help in case you get attacked by one of the bad rogues. Don't thank me, just be kind to the good ones. Okay?",
	
"regretful_rogue_diag_12":	"Say that you'll try?",
	
"regretful_rogue_diag_13":	"I'll try.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_14":	"Rogue nods and ends conversation.",
	
"regretful_rogue_diag_15":	"I'm not going to promise you anything.",
"regretful_rogue_diag_16":	"Rogue frowns, shrugs, and ends the conversation.",
	
"rogue_historian_diag_0":	"Oh, hi, stranger. New to this world?",
"rogue_historian_diag_1":	"...",
"rogue_historian_diag_2":	"Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm not a murderer.",
"rogue_historian_diag_3":	"But you are a rogue?",
"rogue_historian_diag_4":	"Oh, yeah. Why else I would be here?",
"rogue_historian_diag_5":	"You shrug.",
"rogue_historian_diag_6":	"Continue conversation?",
	
"rogue_historian_diag_7":	"How do people become rogues?",
"rogue_historian_diag_8":	"Usually by committing very serious crimes. Again with that look. My crime was merely writing a book.",
"rogue_historian_diag_9":	"I was a historian and people didn't like what I wrote, to put it lightly. You see, I think monarchy was good for Kayos.",
"rogue_historian_diag_10":	"Councils and elections are great, sure, but, damn, when a king decides to get something done, it happens.",
"rogue_historian_diag_11":	"I expressed such views in my book, so I was called a monarchist and made a rogue.",
"rogue_historian_diag_12":	"There is a spell that creates this irremovable glowing mark. The guards attack rogues on sight, that's why I am here, living in the desert.",
"rogue_historian_diag_13":	"That is horrible.",
"rogue_historian_diag_14":	"It is. The city councils keep talking about building prisons, making punishments reversible and more humane, but nothing has been done for years.",
"rogue_historian_diag_15":	"He sighs.",
"rogue_historian_diag_16":	"That's what happens when the monarchy isn't in charge.",
"rogue_historian_diag_17":	"He says, almost mockingly. He seems regretful.",
"rogue_historian_diag_18":	"What happened? To the monarchy, I mean?",
"rogue_historian_diag_19":	"The rebellion happened. Talyann the Third wasn't a good king and war broke out.",
"rogue_historian_diag_20":	"It lasted seven bloody years and ended with monarchy losing.",
"rogue_historian_diag_21":	"At the end of the war, Talyann the Fourth blew up half of what was the Kingdom of Azu'urunn.",
"rogue_historian_diag_22":	"Half of the inhabited lands, basically. Three cities were in the range of the King's Spell, hundreds of thousands died.",
"rogue_historian_diag_23":	"Five years later, my book was released, and, well, you know what happened.",
"rogue_historian_diag_24":	"I'm starting to understand why you were made a rogue.",
"rogue_historian_diag_25":	"Oh yeah?",
"rogue_historian_diag_26":	"Historian says sarcastically and shakes his head.",
"rogue_historian_diag_27":	"I should have waited before writing that damn book.",
"rogue_historian_diag_28":	"Nowadays I could get away with just becoming a widely unliked person. It was a bit early to express that kind of opinion.",
"rogue_historian_diag_29":	"There is another thing that I regret. I wrote that this whole rogue thing was a good way to deal with criminals.",
"rogue_historian_diag_30":	"I don't think that anymore. I have to admit, not everything monarchy did was good. Rebels had a point.",
"rogue_historian_diag_31":	"See? I'm reasonable.",
"rogue_historian_diag_32":	"He makes a sour smile.",
"rogue_historian_diag_33":	"Oh, well. Go now, leave the old fool with his throughs.",
"rogue_historian_diag_34":	"Go.",
	
"rogue_historian_diag_35":	"Well, I'd talk with you, but I don't want to be here longer than I have to.",
"rogue_historian_diag_36":	"Disappointment appears on the old man's face, but he nods.",
"rogue_historian_diag_37":	"Fair enough. Bye, stranger.",
	
"diag_helpful_rogue_0":	"Hello!",
"diag_helpful_rogue_1":	"Hello." ,
"diag_helpful_rogue_2":	"You look troubled, what's the problem?",
"diag_helpful_rogue_3":	"Oh, it's nothing, I'm just trying to get to Locul.",
"diag_helpful_rogue_4":	"I can help you with that, I know a shortcut.",
"diag_helpful_rogue_5":	"Hmm...",
"diag_helpful_rogue_6":	"C'mon, you can trust me.",
"diag_helpful_rogue_7":	"Trust her?",
	
"diag_helpful_rogue_8":	"Thank you, but I don't think I need help.",
"diag_helpful_rogue_9":	"Woman narrows her eyes.",
	
"diag_helpful_rogue_10":	"Well, okay. Show me the way.",
	
"diag_helpful_rogue_11":	"Good job, Alanna.",
	
"ria_quest_started_0":	"You need to get to the town, it's not safe here.",
	
"ria_after_quest_0":	"Hi. You doing alright?",
	
"ria_after_quest_1":	"Not really, I have some problems at the moment. But I'll be alright.",
"ria_after_quest_2":	"Good luck!",
	
"ria_after_quest_3":	"Yeah, I'm alright. Thanks for your help.",
"ria_after_quest_4":	"Don't mention it. Good luck to you.",
	
"diag_kayos_intro_0":	"You stop for a moment to catch your breath.",
"diag_kayos_intro_1":	"When you are no longer focused on moving, your senses capture hundreds of things you haven't got used to yet.",
"diag_kayos_intro_2":	"The warm wind. A giant sun in the sky that didn't move since you got here. Sounds of people shouting in the distance.",
"diag_kayos_intro_3":	"A smell of smoke, iron, and hot stone. A taste of dust. A view of pits, rocks, and broken equipment.",
"diag_kayos_intro_4":	"Kayos.",
"diag_kayos_intro_5":	"You say quietly, just to hear how it sounds again. It's the first time you used this word. You know that it's not the last.",
"diag_kayos_intro_6":	"A strange feeling overtakes you, a mix of hope and anxiety. A bit of hope and lots of anxiety.",
"diag_kayos_intro_7":	"Your thoughts are interrupted when you hear shouting again. It's closer this time. You have to move.",
	
"diag_45":	"Hi, I'm looking for something to do.",
"diag_46":	"Aden looks at you.",
"diag_47":	"Are you an immigrant?",
"diag_48":	"That's what everyone is calling me.",
"diag_49":	"Got it. Can you fight? I got a bit of a rogue problem.",
"diag_50":	"A rogue problem?",
"diag_51":	"Here in Kayos, we don't put our criminals in the prisons, like in more civilized worlds.",
"diag_53":	"We mark them with magic and then try to keep them away from settlements.",
"diag_54":	"We call them rogues. Most of them continue being a threat to civilians.",
"diag_56":	"Yeah, I noticed.",
"diag_57":	"Well, it's not hard to keep them away from this town, rogues in the desert aren't well equipped. At least for now. That brings me to my problem.",
"diag_58":	"You see, before me, the guard captain was Drenn Beknom.",
"diag_59":	"He is a monarchist and Lord Atan's ally. He wanted to take over Locul and turn it into Lord Atan's outpost to attack Eastern Trilith.",
"diag_60":	"I'm sorry, but that does not mean anything to me.",
"diag_61":	"What you need to know is that we overthrew our king twenty years ago after a long war.",
"diag_62":	"There are still people who want tyranny back, most notable of them is Lord Atan. He's trying to crown himself and restore the monarchy.",
"diag_63":	"Drenn wants to help Atan. Drenn was probably from the minority of people who had a good life during the reign and lost that during the war.",
"diag_64":	"So what happened to him?",
"diag_65":	"Long story short, I found out about his plans, now he's a rogue hiding in the desert and I have become a captain.",
"diag_66":	"I'm worried that Drenn have not abandoned his plans. I have reports of rogues becoming more organized.",
"diag_67":	"A weapon merchant was attacked a few days ago. A crate of swords and arrow launcher parts was taken.",
"diag_68":	"I think Drenn is behind this.",
"diag_69":	"Here's the deal: You kill Drenn for me, bring me his captain's badge, and I reward you with a thousand gold.",
"diag_70":	"Sounds good?",
"diag_110":	"You suppress a hysteric laugh.",
"diag_84":	"So that's what kind of world it is? I'm not a pacifist, but I'm also not a bounty hunter. I don't think I can do it.",
"diag_85":	"Oh, you can. And you should. If you won't stop Drenn, innocent people might die.",
"diag_86":	"And yeah, that's what kind of world Kayos is. But you can help make it better. Preserve what's left of civilization after centuries of regime.",
"diag_87":	"%A monarch does not feed those who disobey.%",
"diag_88":	"Aden scoffs.",
"diag_89":	"That was the official policy of the monarchy for two hundred years. But kings and queens are no more. Things are going to change.",
"diag_90":	"The prisons will be built, the guilty will be properly judged and punished, Kayos will become a safer world.",
"diag_91":	"Armed guards and bounty hunters won't be needed anymore.",
"diag_71":	"We just have to survive until then.",
"diag_72":	"...",
"diag_73":	"Okay, I'll think about it.",
"diag_74":	"Yeah, do that. As I said, bring me his badge, and I'll reward you.",
"diag_75":	"See you later.",
	
"diag_76":	"Hey, did you do it?",
	
"diag_77":	"Yes, here's his badge.",
"diag_78":	"I told you got what it takes. Don't think about it too much, sometimes you got to spill the blood to protect the civilization.",
"diag_100":	"You are right, but I don't know if it should be me who does that. Maybe-... No. I can't think about this right now.",
"diag_101":	"Just know that Kayos needs fighters and defenders. Take your gold, you really earned it.",
"diag_79":	"Aden hands you reward.",
"diag_80":	"Well, that's it I guess. I got no more quests for you at the moment.",
"diag_81":	"Alright, bye for now. I'll go spend that gold.",
"diag_111":	"Yeah, you do that.",
	
"diag_82":	"Not yet.",
"diag_83":	"Well, hurry up then.",
	
"diag_99":	"Hey, about that job I gave you. Don't worry about it, someone else has killed him",
"diag_102":	"...",
	
"diag_104":	"Got no quests for you at the moment. Come back later.",
	
"diag_105":	"Hi.",
